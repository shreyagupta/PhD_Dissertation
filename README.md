Chapter 1 codes:
- `simulator_20.py`: (Python) Main simulation engine that imports the following files:
  - `FabConstructorDDD4.py`
  - `Arrival_Simulator.py`
  - `CreateInputMatrix.py`
- `test_stats2.py`: (Python) Creates and stores average test statistics such as average cycle time, standard deviation of cycle time, etc.
- `Hypothesis Testing v8 1.R`: (R) For test which algorithms are statistically significantly better than the others.

Chapter 2 codes:
- `Regression_code_v6.R`: (R) Implements the main count regressin algorithm.
- `rank3.py`: (Python) Generates ranking for the Tukey-HSD method.
- `rankCorrelation2.py`: (Python) Compares different ranking algorithms by computing different rank correlations between the ranks generated by those algorithms.

Chapter 3 codes:
- `Average Cost Multichain MDP Epilepsy Optimization Code using Pyomo v4.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to solve the dual LP corresponding to an average cost MDP that maximizes rewards.
  - `LP-MDP.py`: Corresponding python file.
- `Robust Average Cost Multichain MDP Epilepsy Optimization Code using Pyomo v3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to solve the modified dual LP corresponding to a robust average cost MDP that maximizes rewards.
  - `Robust-MDP.py`: Corresponding python file.
