Then re-read the new spreadsheet below and run all the cells again.*\n",

    "    - Changed generic state names to action specific state names. E.g., *No Improvement* was modified to *No Improvement w/o AED*, *No Improvement with 1st AED*, *No Improvement with 2nd AED*, and so on.\n",
    "    - Also changed first column of *Workup to Surgery with 3rd AED* to be *No Improvement with 3rd AED* in stead of *No Improvement with 3rd AED*. The reasoning being that no change is caused due to the workup since it's not a treatment but only a procedure to determine suitability for surgery. The treatment here is actually the 3rd AED.\n",

    "    - Changed first column of *Workup to Surgery with 3rd AED* back to *No Improvement with 3rd AED* from *No Improvement with 3rd AED* for convenience. **I am leaning towards reverting this again and also reducing the corresponding four rows under action *Surgery or resection to two rows* because it logically makes sense since *Workup to Surgery* is not a treatmdnt.**\n",
